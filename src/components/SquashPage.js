      <p>
        When growing squash, the first thing you should do is to bury several squash seeds in some dirt.
        This is called "planting", "sowing", or "squashing". A prerequisite step, of course, is to find
        dirt; I found some in two neglected raised beds in the yard, which you can just make out in the
        images below:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/raised_beds_pre_prep_2.jpeg" alt="Image of overgrown raised planting bed 1"></img>
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/raised_beds_pre_prep_3.jpeg" alt="Image of overgrown raised planting bed 2"></img>
        </div>

        As you can see, plants have successfully grown here before, so I knew I was on the right track.
      </p>
      <p>
        I set about clearing the beds of weeds and old leaves. This left only a layer of old dirt and some
        slugs, which seemed keen to wander out on their own:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/slug_2.jpeg" alt="Image of slug leaving raised planting bed 1"></img>
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/slug_4.jpeg" alt="Image of slug leaving raised planting bed 2"></img>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        When all was said and done:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-large" src="/squash/raised_beds_post_prep_1.jpeg" alt="Image of cleared raised beds"></img>
        </div>

        A casual observer may find nothing remarkable in the image above, but close inspection reveals two different colors of dirt.
        This indicates something critical about the acidity, moisture level, and age -- in other words, the squash-friendliness --
        of the soil, I'm sure. Expect the blog to revisit this observation frequently as we compare the growth patterns of the squash
        in each box. Never mind that one box will hold butternut squash and the other, zucchini.
      </p>
      <p>
        After clearing the boxes, it was time to put down a layer of fresh soil. I always use Organic All Natural Garden Soil for
        this purpose:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-large" src="/squash/soil_bags.jpeg" alt="Image of soil bags"></img>
          <br />
          <img class="img-large" src="/squash/raised_beds_post_soil_2.jpeg" alt="Image of beds and pot with fresh soil"></img>
        </div>

        These beds are looking good! You'll notice, too, a small pot in frame. This also got a fresh layer of soil, but what will be planted
        there?? No soilers!
      </p>
      <p>
        It was now time to plant. In the left box, I buried approximately 9 zucchini seeds in a sort of geometrically optimized
        lattice pattern. These are probably closer together than they eventually should be, so I may trim a couple out later. In the right
        box, I planted 4 butternut squash seeds in a squarish pattern. In the small pot in the middle, I planted several jalape√±o
        seeds in a sort of snowflake or flower pattern, with one in the middle and several around the edge. You may also think of this as
        a hub-and-spoke pattern or a pizza pie pattern. To think of it as any other type of pattern would be incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The location of the raised beds is admittedly not ideal for growing squash, as I don't believe the boxes get as much sunlight
        as squash would prefer, but we'll see.

      <h2 id="first-sprouts">First Sprouts (6/13/23 - 6/18/23)</h2>
      <p>
        It's been a couple weeks since my last post. Time flies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since planting is already done, I won't bury the <i>seed</i> in this post -- we now have sprouts! Two of them:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/first_sprouts.jpeg" alt="Image of two zucchini sprouts"></img>
        </div>

        These are both in the zucchini box, and, as you can see, they are next to each other. Please see the following image
        for their precise location within the box:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/first_sprouts_all_seed_locations.jpeg" alt="Image showing location of all planted squash seeds"></img>
        </div>

        Of the 13 squash seeds I planted (4 in one box and 9 in the other), the first two to sprout are direct neighbors...a curious coincidence, to the tune
        of a 0.27 probability*. I guess that's not actually <i>so</i> unlikely. But regardless, what is it about these two seeds, or their adjacent
        locations, that made them germinate first? It's an interesting question, worthy of wild speculation.
      </p>

      <h4>Theory 1: soil characteristics</h4>
      <p>
        Recall the observation in the previous post (see: "Planting (5/29/23)") that the color of the two boxes' base soils differed.
        Perhaps the soil in the zucchini box is more hospitible. This doesn't explain why our two specific zucchini seeds sprouted
        earlier than the other zucchini seeds, but it's something. It's also a satisfying callback to the last post.
      </p>

      <h4>Theory 2: spotty watering</h4>
      <p>
        I probably underwatered the seeds over their first two weeks. With fewer waterings, the importance of each was likely magnified, so if one
        watering happened to be more favorable for our two seeds, that may have made the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        An additional point in support of this theory is that, at least once, I watered using a large plastic bucket rather than a proper watering can. The water
        tended to slosh out unevenly, making it more likely that some seeds received the "right" amount of water and others didn't.
      </p>

      <h4>Theory 3: help from dog</h4>
      <p>
        A dog visited our yard recently and spent some time exploring the raised beds:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/dog.jpeg" alt="Image of dog sniffing zucchini box"></img>
        </div>

        It appears from this picture that he took particular interest in exactly the area where our two sprouts appeared. This raises some intriguing possibilities:

        <ol>
          <li>The dog aerated the soil by digging around</li>
          <li>Dog saliva helps squash grow</li>
          <li>Proximity to dog barking helps squash grow</li>
        </ol>

        Whatever the specifics, I find this theory -- "help from dog" -- the most plausible. Please be sure to comment if you disagree,
        or if you have other theories!
      </p>

      Until next time!

      <h3>*Appendix A: 0.27</h3>
      The "0.27 probability" was figured using the following definitions of seed adjacency:

      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/first_sprouts_all_seed_locations_neighbors.jpeg" alt="Image of overgrown raised planting bed 1"></img>
      </div>

      This graph contains 21 distinct pairs of neighboring seeds, and it contains 78 total distinct pairs of seeds. 21 / 78 &asymp; 0.27.

        I recently placed last in a fantasy football league, and so I was asked to grow squash.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all seriousness, I think gardening is pretty cool and am excited for this challenge; I hope to do a good job.
        This blog is just some nonsense!
