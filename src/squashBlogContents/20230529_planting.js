        When growing squash, the first thing you should do is to bury several squash seeds in some dirt.
        This is called "planting", "sowing", or "squashing". A prerequisite step, of course, is to find
        dirt; I found some in two neglected raised beds in the yard, which you can just make out in the
        images below:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/raised_beds_pre_prep_2.jpeg" alt="Image of overgrown raised planting bed 1"></img>
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/raised_beds_pre_prep_3.jpeg" alt="Image of overgrown raised planting bed 2"></img>
        </div>

        As you can see, plants have successfully grown here before, so I knew I was on the right track.
      </p>

        I set about clearing the beds of weeds and old leaves. This left only a layer of old dirt and some
        slugs, which seemed keen to wander out on their own:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/slug_2.jpeg" alt="Image of slug leaving raised planting bed 1"></img>
          <img class="img-medium" src="/squash/slug_4.jpeg" alt="Image of slug leaving raised planting bed 2"></img>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        When all was said and done:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-large" src="/squash/raised_beds_post_prep_1.jpeg" alt="Image of cleared raised beds"></img>
        </div>

        A casual observer may find nothing remarkable in the image above, but close inspection reveals two different colors of dirt.
        This indicates something critical about the acidity, moisture level, and age -- in other words, the squash-friendliness --
        of the soil, I'm sure. Expect the blog to revisit this observation frequently as we compare the growth patterns of the squash
        in each box. Never mind that one box will hold butternut squash and the other, zucchini.
      </p>
      <p>
        After clearing the boxes, it was time to put down a layer of fresh soil. I always use Organic All Natural Garden Soil for
        this purpose:

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="img-large" src="/squash/soil_bags.jpeg" alt="Image of soil bags"></img>
          <br />
          <img class="img-large" src="/squash/raised_beds_post_soil_2.jpeg" alt="Image of beds and pot with fresh soil"></img>
        </div>

        These beds are looking good! You'll notice, too, a small pot in frame. This also got a fresh layer of soil, but what will be planted
        there?? No soilers!
      </p>
      <p>
        It was now time to plant. In the left box, I buried approximately 9 zucchini seeds in a sort of geometrically optimized
        lattice pattern. These are probably closer together than they eventually should be, so I may trim a couple out later. In the right
        box, I planted 4 butternut squash seeds in a squarish pattern. In the small pot in the middle, I planted several jalape√±o
        seeds in a sort of snowflake or flower pattern, with one in the middle and several around the edge. You may also think of this as
        a hub-and-spoke pattern or a pizza pie pattern. To think of it as any other type of pattern would be incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The location of the raised beds is admittedly not ideal for growing squash, as I don't believe the boxes get as much sunlight
        as squash would prefer, but we'll see.
