          Big news: we now have sprouts in all three pots / boxes! Nine of the 13 original squash seeds
          appear to have sprouted, along with a few of the jalapeño seeds. Some close-ups below.

          We've had some hard rains here in the past couple weeks. I wasn't sure how the team (i.e., the seeds)
          would handle it, but so far, so good, at least to my eyes.
